     "survey_description": "The EENergy Efficiency project, funded by the EU’s Single Market Program (SMP), supports Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in improving their energy efficiency by providing guidance from sustainability advisors and financial grants.\n\nAll 1,406 eligible EENergy applicants receive guidance from a sustainability advisor, and 707 of these applicants, chosen by lottery, are awarded grants of up to €10,000. This financial support is intended to help implement energy efficiency action plans through investments in technology, specialized consultancy, and skills enhancement.\n\nAs a pilot study, the program is part of DG GROW’s efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of these financial grants. Therefore, an impact assessment is being conducted in tandem with the program to provide deeper insights into the benefits of direct financial support.\n\n**Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly confidential. All information you provide will be anonymized and used solely for the purpose of evaluating the program's effectiveness. Individual responses will not be shared outside the evaluation team, and no personally identifiable information will be disclosed in any reports or publications.**\n\nWe seek your perspective on the potential impact of receiving a €10,000 grant alongside standard support from sustainability advisors, compared to receiving only the standard support. Your insights are invaluable and will help us assess the effectiveness of the grant program. We would be grateful if you could take a moment to share your thoughts by responding to the questions below.\n\nEstimated completion time is around 30 minutes.\n\nThank you for your time and collaboration!"

It is calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total energy costs. A higher ratio indicates better energy efficiency, meaning the company generates more revenue per unit of energy cost. For instance, let us say we have two companies, A and B, each with the following figures for a given year:  \n\n- Company A:\n  - Revenue: 1,000,000\u20AC\n  - Energy Costs: 100,000\u20AC\n  - Energy-Revenue Cost Ratio: 1,000,000\u20AC / 100,000\u20AC = 10  \n\n- Company B:\n  - Revenue: 1,500,000\u20AC\n  - Energy Costs: 250,000\u20AC\n  - Energy-Revenue Cost Ratio: 1,500,000\u20AC / 250,000\u20AC = 6  \n\nIn this example, Company A has a higher Energy-Revenue cost ratio (10) compared to Company B (6), indicating that Company A is more efficient in generating revenue per unit of energy cost.
